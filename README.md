# Tensor-Decomposition-on-fUS

This project analyzes functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging data using tensor decomposition techniques, specifically focusing on Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Block Term Decomposition (BTD). The MATLAB code provided implements these decompositions to extract and visualize significant spatiotemporal patterns from fUS images. These techniques are useful for isolating and interpreting neural activity patterns, as demonstrated in the experimental data.
